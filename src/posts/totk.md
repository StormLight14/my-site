## Background
If you somehow haven't heard of this game by now, it is the latest Legend of Zelda game created by Nintendo, as a sequel to Breath of the Wild. A huge difference in this game, however, is that there are now islands in the sky to explore, as well as a huge underground called the Depths.

Tears of the Kingdom has the player explore a vast, open world full of shrines and puzzles, which the player can almost always solve in more ways than one.

The player is given a variety of powers (many of which are given after the game's tutorial sky island) to use throughout the game:
* Recall - rewind objects' positions through time.
* Ultra-Hand - allows the player to pick up and connect objects together. This can be used with Zonai devices to make vehicles and a bunch of other things!
* Fuse - combine a weapon or shield with another object to make a new weapon or shield!
* Ascend - if there is a ceiling directly above the player (that is close enough), then the player can phase (swim?? idk) through it to the top.
* amiibo - lets the player get items using real-life money... wait what

The previously mentioned Zonai devices are various devices like wheels, fans, and **flamethrowers** that the player can use on their own, combine to other things using Ultra-Hand, or fuse to their items.
